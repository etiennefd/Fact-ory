 by turning  charges back on  grits they can not only tar their opponents as scheming anti - democratic hypocrites but may hope  partially exonerate themselves  after all  everybody does it then self - interested power plays like  fair elections act are no longer assaults on democracy or even particularly odious but mere politics as usual but hold on  are  two morally equivalent ?  there ' s  certain symmetry granted  :   much  bill c - 76 as  legislation is known would simply repeal various provisions   fair elections act  but  one party ' s changes   elections law can be criticized as self - serving so far as they appear  favour that party ' s interests is it equally self - serving for another party  reverse them ?  more broadly is that  only test  whether  given change  policy is  be desired  :   whether it is   benefit   governing party ? certainly there is  potential for abuse  any such exercise even  suspicion  which should be enough  warn governments away from imposing broad changes   elections law without some degree  cross - party consensus or at  very least consultation  curtailing debate on  bill  parliament as  liberals did wednesday is hardly conducive  that consensus  —  though  better test will be whether  grits are willing  accept opposition amendments  committee there is what is more much  criticize   bill  far from banning all foreign interference  canadian elections it leaves open  giant loophole that would seem  permit much   financial funny - business seen  previous campaigns  rather than subjecting political parties   same limits faced by private corporations under  federal privacy act  bill gives  parties continued carte blanche  use canadians '  personal data as they wish  :   they just have  report how instead  putting parties   ' third - party '  advocacy groups on  even footing each as legitimate avenues for citizen self - expression   democracy  bill blatantly favours  parties allowing them  spend orders  magnitude more  influence public opinion at election time  parties would continue  benefit likewise from  uniquely generous tax credit available  contributors as they would from  partial reimbursement  candidates '  expenses would  bill also be   particular benefit   liberal party ?  no doubt it would  some respects  foreign contributions  canadian political campaigns have not tended  be for  benefit   conservatives ;  that as much as any concern for principle may explain why  conservatives have been so eager  close it off   liberals so reluctant  at  same time limits on campaign spending are presumably   benefit   party that has less money  spend  (  liberals )  versus  party that has more  (  conservatives )   which may again explain  parties '  positions but so what ?   proper question  ask  any reform is not which party happens  benefit disproportionately from it but whether it helps or harms our democracy just because  policy is   advantage or otherwise   party doesn ' t make it bad policy  we can surely agree that eliminating foreign influence from canadian elections for example is  good thing  :   that this might benefit  tories or disbenefit  liberals is secondary  neither is  bad policy saved merely because it is unclear which party might profit from it most  that doesn ' t mean we should be insensitive   ways  which  otherwise defensible policy might have  effect  benefiting one party or another  some limits on campaign spending during  pre - writ period such as bill c - 76 would impose is probably wise but  conservatives are right  point out how this might favour  governing party with all   resources at its disposal ;  their proposal for offsetting limits on government advertising   same period likewise probably has merit  same lens should be applied   changes enacted under  conservatives  what made  fair elections act so pernicious was not  extent  which its provisions might have tilted  playing field  favour   conservatives but  collateral damage  other important democratic principles  excluding  use  voter information cards or vouching as means  voter identification for example is wrong not because it might be   advantage  one party or another but because   many voters it might disenfranchise by  same token earlier reforms such as eliminating corporate  union donations  abolishing  per - vote subsidy might have been   advantage   conservatives with their comparatively large base  small individual donors  that may even  —  who knows ?   —  have been  intent  but it was also good policy parties will always seek advantage  that ' s  given  but it is  effect not  intent  policy that counts ;   fairness between  parties is but one consideration among many  maybe not even  especially important one "
